# MatchingHarshCard
Here's my first tiny matching card game ðŸŽ®  : "Matching Harsh."  It also contains sound effects, which will improve the experience both visually and auditorily.

MatchingHarshCard is a compelling mobile puzzle game in which players try to match pairs of identical cards to remove them from the grid. The game progresses through various time seconds, which are 100 seconds, with straightforward touch controls and sound effects, providing a perfect balance of challenge and relaxation. One of the features is that it promotes an enjoyable experience for players of all ages. The game is free, which ensures accessibility and replay value. Dive into the universe of card match games for a memory-boosting journey.
